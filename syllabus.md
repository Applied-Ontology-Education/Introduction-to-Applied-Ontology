# Introduction to Applied Ontology  
**Format:** Asynchronous / Online  
**Duration:** 15 Weeks  
**Instructor:** Dr. John Beverley  
**Contact:** ncornetwork@gmail.com

## Course Description
This course introduces participants to the theory and practice of **applied ontology**, a field concerned with the systematic disambiguation of information using machines. Participants learn what ontologies are, how they are built, and how they are used to solve real-world problems. By the end of the course, participants will be able to understand and contribute to ontology development projects, evaluate ontological models, and apply ontological reasoning to interdisciplinary domains such as defense, health, and artificial intelligence.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Explain the role of ontologies in enabling **human-human**, **human-machine**, and **machine-machine** interoperability.  
2. Apply methods of **top-down**, **bottom-up**, and **middle-in** modeling to real-world domains.  
3. Understand the philosophical and methodological foundations of **applied ontology**.  
4. Use **hub-and-spoke modularization** to design and integrate interoperable ontology modules.  
5. Analyze concrete ontology applications in **military**, **medical**, and **AI** systems.  
6. Use ontology engineering tools to model and test ontologies.

## Course Structure

### *What Are Ontologies?* (Weeks 1–4)
An exploration of what ontologies are and why they matter. Participants will study the role of ontologies in promoting interoperability and systematic meaning across domains.

## Assessment
Nearly each week, there will be an assignment that must be completed. Assingments will be taken online. The course schedule includes links to each assignment by week it is due. Each assignment is due by Friday evening at 11:59 of the week that it is assigned. 

You must input your full name when you complete the assignment. If you do not, you will not receive credit.
